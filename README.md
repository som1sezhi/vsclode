## Features

* Inserts the updates right where your eyes are looking â€” at your cursor position
* Easy-to-use: a simple toggle on or off through the Command Palette (`Enable Live Blaseball Updates` and `Disable Live Blaseball Updates` respectively)
* Improves the relative accessibility of Blaseball by reducing the accessibility of doing anything else
* Absolutely repulsive extension name
* Functional*
* Zero calories

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `vsclode.endpoint`: URL of SSE stream to fetch game data from
* `vsclode.gameNumber`: Select which game out of the 10(?) simultaneous games to watch

## (Un)known Issues

* Error checking might be a bit dubious
* I don't know if the `test/` folder is important and I don't feel like finding out
* The possibility that I'm misunderstanding the API and networking in general and this doesn't actually work properly
    * My apathy towards the above possibility

## Release Notes

### 0.0.1

* Initial release

## License

MIT. I don't want this in my house anymore
